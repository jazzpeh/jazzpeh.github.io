# A 80% debugging, 20% coding programmer life

Decided to start a blog to record everything that I learnt, or maybe even guides so that I can refer to when I forget about them.

## Development

Just some notable things to remember.

### Running it locally

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

## Credits

I'm using this amazing theme - `Memoirs Jekyll Theme`. Check it out [here](https://bootstrapstarter.com/bootstrap-templates/jekyll-theme-memoirs/).
